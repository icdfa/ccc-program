## Project Scenario

### Client Profile

**Client Name:** Fintech Solutions, Inc.

**Industry:** Financial Technology (Fintech)

**Size:** Mid-sized company with 500 employees

**Revenue:** $150 million annually

**Locations:** Headquarters in New York City, with satellite offices in London and Singapore

### Business Overview

Fintech Solutions is a rapidly growing financial technology company that provides a mobile payment platform called "PaySwift." The platform allows users to send and receive money, pay bills, and make purchases using their smartphones. The company has experienced significant growth over the past three years, with its user base expanding from 100,000 to over 5 million users.

### Recent Challenges

Fintech Solutions has recently faced several cybersecurity challenges:

1. **Data Breach:** Six months ago, the company experienced a data breach that exposed the personal information of approximately 50,000 customers. The breach was caused by a SQL injection vulnerability in the company's web application. While the company responded quickly and notified affected customers, the incident resulted in significant reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny.

2. **Regulatory Compliance:** The company operates in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to various regulations, including GDPR (in the EU), CCPA (in California), and PCI DSS (for payment card processing). The company has struggled to keep up with the evolving regulatory landscape and is concerned about potential compliance violations.

3. **Rapid Growth:** The company's rapid growth has outpaced its security capabilities. The IT and security teams are understaffed and overwhelmed. The company's security infrastructure was designed for a much smaller organization and is no longer adequate.

4. **Cloud Migration:** The company is planning to migrate its infrastructure from on-premises data centers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) within the next 12 months. The company is concerned about the security implications of this migration.

### Executive Concerns

The CEO and Board of Directors have expressed the following concerns:

- **Customer Trust:** The data breach has eroded customer trust. The company needs to demonstrate a strong commitment to security to regain that trust.
- **Regulatory Penalties:** The company is concerned about potential fines and penalties for non-compliance with regulations.
- **Business Continuity:** The company needs to ensure that it can continue to operate in the event of a major cyber incident.
- **Competitive Advantage:** The company wants to use security as a competitive differentiator in the fintech market.

### Your Engagement

Fintech Solutions has engaged you, a cybersecurity consultant, to help them address these challenges. The company is looking for a comprehensive assessment of their current security posture and a strategic roadmap for improving their security over the next three years.

## Tips for Success

### Start Early

The capstone project is substantial and will require significant time and effort. Start planning and working on it as early as possible in Module 4.

### Treat It as Real

Approach this project as if Fintech Solutions were a real client. Put yourself in the mindset of a professional consultant and deliver work that you would be proud to present to an actual client.

### Use the Templates

The templates provided in the Templates folder are designed to help you structure your deliverables professionally. Use them as a starting point and customize them as needed.

### Be Specific

Avoid generic recommendations. Be specific about what Fintech Solutions should do, how they should do it, and why it matters to their business.

### Show Your Work

For the Security Assessment Report, provide evidence to support your findings. This could include references to industry reports, vulnerability databases, or simulated scan results.

### Think Strategically

Remember that you are a strategic consultant, not just a technical expert. Always connect your recommendations to business objectives and demonstrate the value of security investments.

### Proofread

Before submitting, carefully proofread all of your deliverables. Spelling and grammatical errors can undermine your credibility as a professional consultant.

### Get Feedback

If possible, have a peer or mentor review your work before submitting. Fresh eyes can catch issues that you might have missed.

-## Assignment 1.1: The Consultant's Role - Statement of Work (SOW)

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of the cybersecurity consultant's role and the consulting lifecycle. You will be required to develop a professional Statement of Work (SOW) for a simulated security assessment engagement.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Financially Secure," a mid-sized financial institution.

**Background:** Financially Secure has recently experienced a minor security incident involving a phishing attack that resulted in the compromise of a few employee email accounts. While no customer data was breached, the incident has raised concerns at the executive level about the institution's overall security posture. The CEO has engaged you, a cybersecurity consultant, to conduct a comprehensive security assessment.

**Initial Discussion Points with the CEO:**

- The CEO wants to understand the institution's current security posture.
- They are concerned about compliance with financial regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, GLBA).
- They want to know if their current security controls are adequate to protect against common cyber threats.
- They have a limited budget for the assessment and want a clear understanding of the costs and deliverables.

### Your Task

Based on the scenario and the initial discussion points, develop a professional Statement of Work (SOW) for the security assessment engagement. The SOW should be comprehensive and should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction/Overview:** A brief overview of the engagement, including the client's name and the purpose of the SOW.
2.  **Scope of Work:** A detailed description of the services to be provided. This should include:
    -   The specific systems, networks, and applications that will be assessed.
    -   The types of assessments that will be conducted (e.g., vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, policy review).
    -   Any areas that are explicitly out of scope.
3.  **Deliverables:** A list of the specific deliverables that will be provided to the client. This should include:
    -   A detailed security assessment report with findings and recommendations.
    -   An executive summary presentation.
    -   A debriefing meeting with the client's stakeholders.
4.  **Timeline:** A high-level timeline for the engagement, including key milestones and deadlines.
5.  **Assumptions:** A list of any assumptions that you have made in developing the SOW.
6.  **Client Responsibilities:** A list of the client's responsibilities, such as providing access to systems and personnel.
7.  **Pricing and Payment Terms:** A clear and transparent breakdown of the costs for the engagement, including any travel and expenses. You should also specify the payment terms.
8.  **Terms and Conditions:** Standard terms and conditions, such as confidentiality, liability, and termination clauses.

### Submission Format

Please submit your SOW as a single Markdown file. The SOW should be professionally written and should be free from grammatical errors.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your SOW will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Completeness:** Does the SOW include all of the required sections?
-   **Clarity:** Is the SOW clear, concise, and easy to understand?
-   **Professionalism:** Is the SOW professionally written and formatted?
-   **Realism:** Is the scope of work, timeline, and pricing realistic for the given scenario?

-## Assignment 1.2: Business Risk Management - Qualitative Risk Assessment

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of business risk management and your ability to perform a qualitative risk assessment. You will be required to conduct a risk assessment for a simulated client's new product launch.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Innovate Inc.," a technology startup.

**Background:** Innovate Inc. is preparing to launch a new mobile application called "ConnectSphere." ConnectSphere is a social networking app that allows users to share photos, videos, and personal updates. The app will also have a feature that allows users to make in-app purchases.

**Your Role:** You are a cybersecurity consultant who has been hired by Innovate Inc. to conduct a risk assessment for the ConnectSphere app.

### Your Task

Based on the scenario, conduct a qualitative risk assessment for the ConnectSphere app. Your risk assessment should include the following:

1.  **Asset Identification:** Identify the key assets that need to be protected. This should include data assets (e.g., user data, financial data), as well as technology assets (e.g., the mobile app, the backend servers).
2.  **Threat Identification:** Identify the potential threats to the ConnectSphere app. This should include both internal and external threats, as well as both malicious and accidental threats.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Identify the potential vulnerabilities in the ConnectSphere app. This should include both technical vulnerabilities (e.g., software bugs, misconfigurations) and non-technical vulnerabilities (e.g., weak passwords, lack of security awareness).
4.  **Risk Analysis:** For each identified risk (i.e., a combination of a threat and a vulnerability), assess the likelihood and impact of the risk. You should use a qualitative scale for your assessment (e.g., low, medium, high).
5.  **Risk Prioritization:** Prioritize the identified risks based on their likelihood and impact. You should use a risk matrix to help you with this.
6.  **Risk Treatment Recommendations:** For each of the high-priority risks, recommend a risk treatment option (e.g., mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid). You should also provide a brief justification for your recommendation.

### Submission Format

Please submit your risk assessment as a single Markdown file. The risk assessment should be well-organized and easy to read. You should use tables to present your findings.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your risk assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Completeness:** Have you identified a comprehensive list of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities?
-   **Accuracy:** Is your risk analysis accurate and well-justified?
-   **Clarity:** Is your risk assessment clear, concise, and easy to understand?
-   **Actionability:** Are your risk treatment recommendations actionable and realistic?

-## Assignment 1.3: Security Strategy Development - 3-Year Security Roadmap

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your ability to translate business goals into a multi-year security roadmap. You will be required to draft a 3-year security roadmap for a simulated mid-sized financial institution, including a cost-benefit analysis.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Future Bank," a mid-sized financial institution.

**Background:** Future Bank is a traditional financial institution that is looking to modernize its operations and expand its digital offerings. The bank has recently launched a new mobile banking app and is planning to invest heavily in online and mobile banking services over the next three years. The CEO is concerned about the security implications of this digital transformation and has asked you, a cybersecurity consultant, to develop a 3-year security roadmap.

**Business Goals:**

-   Expand digital banking services.
-   Improve the customer experience.
-   Increase operational efficiency.
-   Maintain compliance with financial regulations.

### Your Task

Based on the scenario and the business goals, draft a 3-year security roadmap for Future Bank. The roadmap should be high-level and should focus on the key security initiatives that will be undertaken over the next three years. For each initiative, you should provide a brief description, a timeline for implementation, and a high-level cost-benefit analysis.

Your roadmap should be organized by year and should include a mix of the following types of initiatives:

-   **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC):** Initiatives related to policies, procedures, and compliance.
-   **Security Operations:** Initiatives related to threat detection and response.
-   **Infrastructure Security:** Initiatives related to securing the bank's network, servers, and endpoints.
-   **Application Security:** Initiatives related to securing the bank's web and mobile applications.
-   **Data Security:** Initiatives related to protecting the bank's sensitive data.

### Submission Format

Please submit your security roadmap as a single Markdown file. The roadmap should be well-organized and easy to read. You should use tables to present your roadmap.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your security roadmap will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Alignment with Business Goals:** Is the roadmap aligned with the bank's business goals?
-   **Comprehensiveness:** Does the roadmap address all of the key areas of security?
-   **Realism:** Is the roadmap realistic and achievable for a mid-sized financial institution?
-   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Is the cost-benefit analysis well-reasoned and justified?

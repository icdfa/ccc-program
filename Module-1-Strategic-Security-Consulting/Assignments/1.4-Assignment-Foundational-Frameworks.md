-## Assignment 1.4: Foundational Frameworks - NIST CSF Mapping

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of foundational cybersecurity frameworks and your ability to map a client's current security controls to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

### Scenario

**Client:** "HealthFirst," a regional healthcare provider.

**Background:** HealthFirst is a regional healthcare provider that operates a network of hospitals and clinics. The organization is subject to a variety of regulations, including HIPAA. The CIO is concerned about the organization's ability to protect patient data and has asked you, a cybersecurity consultant, to assess their current security controls against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

**Current Security Controls:**

-   The organization has a firewall in place to protect its network perimeter.
-   All servers are patched on a monthly basis.
-   The organization uses antivirus software on all endpoints.
-   All employees are required to complete annual security awareness training.
-   The organization has a backup and recovery plan in place.

### Your Task

Based on the scenario and the list of current security controls, map HealthFirst's current security controls to the five functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). For each function, you should identify which of the current security controls apply and provide a brief explanation of how they apply. You should also identify any gaps in their current security controls and provide recommendations for improvement.

### Submission Format

Please submit your NIST CSF mapping as a single Markdown file. The mapping should be well-organized and easy to read. You should use a table to present your mapping.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your NIST CSF mapping will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Accuracy:** Is the mapping of the current security controls to the NIST CSF functions accurate?
-   **Comprehensiveness:** Have you identified all of the relevant gaps in the current security controls?
-   **Actionability:** Are your recommendations for improvement actionable and realistic?
-   **Clarity:** Is your mapping clear, concise, and easy to understand?

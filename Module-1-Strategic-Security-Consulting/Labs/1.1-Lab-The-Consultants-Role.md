# Lab 1.1: The Consultant's Role - Case Study Analysis

### Objective

This lab is designed to provide you with a practical understanding of the cybersecurity consultant's role and the consulting lifecycle. You will be required to analyze a case study of a real-world consulting engagement and to answer a series of questions.

### Case Study: The Stuxnet Attack

For this lab, you will be researching and analyzing the Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was a malicious computer worm that was first identified in 2010. It was designed to target industrial control systems (ICS) and was responsible for causing substantial damage to Iran's nuclear program.

### Your Task

1.  **Research the Stuxnet attack:** Conduct research on the Stuxnet attack using reliable sources (e.g., academic papers, reputable news articles, security vendor reports).
2.  **Analyze the attack from a consultant's perspective:** Imagine that you are a cybersecurity consultant who has been hired by a critical infrastructure organization to provide advice on how to defend against Stuxnet-like attacks. Based on your research, answer the following questions:
    -   What were the key phases of the Stuxnet attack? How does this align with the consulting lifecycle?
    -   Who were the key stakeholders in the Stuxnet attack? What were their motivations and objectives?
    -   What were the key vulnerabilities that were exploited by Stuxnet? How could these vulnerabilities have been mitigated?
    -   What were the key lessons learned from the Stuxnet attack? How can these lessons be applied to other organizations?
3.  **Develop a set of recommendations:** Based on your analysis, develop a set of recommendations for a critical infrastructure organization on how to defend against Stuxnet-like attacks. Your recommendations should be actionable and should be prioritized based on risk.

### Submission Format

Please submit your analysis and recommendations as a single Markdown file. Your submission should be well-organized and easy to read.

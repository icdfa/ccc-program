# Lab 1.2: Business Risk Management - Risk Assessment Workshop

### Objective

This lab will provide you with a hands-on opportunity to apply your knowledge of business risk management by facilitating a simulated risk assessment workshop. You will practice identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks in a real-world business context.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Go-Green," a fast-growing e-commerce company specializing in sustainable and eco-friendly products.

**Background:** Go-Green is planning to launch a new initiative to partner with small, independent artisans from around the world. This will involve collecting personal information from these artisans, including their names, addresses, and bank account details for payment. The company is also planning to launch a new marketing campaign to promote this initiative, which will involve collecting customer data through a new online portal.

**Your Role:** You are a cybersecurity consultant hired by Go-Green to facilitate a risk assessment workshop to identify and assess the potential risks associated with this new initiative.

### Your Task

1.  **Workshop Preparation:**
    *   You will be provided with a list of key stakeholders at Go-Green (e.g., CEO, Head of Marketing, Head of Supply Chain, IT Manager).
    *   Prepare a brief agenda for the risk assessment workshop. The agenda should outline the objectives of the workshop and the key activities that will be conducted.

2.  **Risk Identification:**
    *   During the simulated workshop, you will brainstorm a list of potential risks associated with the new initiative. Consider risks from a variety of perspectives, including:
        *   **Strategic Risks:** Risks that could impact the company's ability to achieve its business objectives.
        *   **Operational Risks:** Risks that could disrupt the company's day-to-day operations.
        *   **Financial Risks:** Risks that could result in financial losses.
        *   **Compliance Risks:** Risks that could result in non-compliance with laws and regulations.

3.  **Risk Analysis and Prioritization:**
    *   For each identified risk, you will lead a discussion to assess its likelihood and impact using a qualitative scale (e.g., low, medium, high).
    *   You will then use a risk matrix to prioritize the risks.

4.  **Risk Treatment Discussion:**
    *   For the top 3-5 risks, you will facilitate a discussion on potential risk treatment options (e.g., mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid).

### Submission Format

Please submit your work as a single Markdown file containing:

1.  The workshop agenda.
2.  A table summarizing the identified risks, their likelihood and impact, and their priority.
3.  A brief summary of the discussion on risk treatment options for the top risks.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

*   **Comprehensiveness of Risk Identification:** Have you identified a wide range of relevant risks?
*   **Soundness of Risk Analysis:** Is your assessment of likelihood and impact logical and well-reasoned?
*   **Clarity of Prioritization:** Is your prioritization of risks clear and justified?
*   **Effectiveness of Facilitation (as demonstrated in your submission):** Does your submission reflect a well-structured and productive workshop?

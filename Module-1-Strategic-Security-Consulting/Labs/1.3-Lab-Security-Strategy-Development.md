# Lab 1.3: Security Strategy Development - Roadmap Simulation

### Objective

This lab will provide you with a practical, hands-on experience in developing a security strategy. You will simulate the process of creating a multi-year security roadmap for a client, aligning security initiatives with business goals.

### Scenario

**Client:** "RetailRevolution," a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer.

**Background:** RetailRevolution is looking to compete with online retailers by launching a new e-commerce platform and a customer loyalty program. The company has a limited IT budget and a small IT team. The CEO is excited about the new digital initiatives but is also concerned about the potential security risks.

**Your Role:** You are a cybersecurity consultant hired by RetailRevolution to help them develop a 3-year security roadmap.

### Your Task

1.  **Business Goal Analysis:**
    *   Identify the key business goals of RetailRevolution.
    *   For each business goal, identify the potential security implications.

2.  **Security Initiative Brainstorming:**
    *   Brainstorm a list of potential security initiatives that would help RetailRevolution to achieve its business goals securely. Consider initiatives across the following domains:
        *   Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
        *   Security Operations
        *   Infrastructure Security
        *   Application Security
        *   Data Security

3.  **Roadmap Development:**
    *   Organize the brainstormed initiatives into a 3-year roadmap. For each initiative, you should specify:
        *   A brief description of the initiative.
        *   The business goal that it supports.
        *   The estimated cost (e.g., low, medium, high).
        *   The estimated effort (e.g., low, medium, high).
        *   The priority (e.g., high, medium, low).

4.  **Roadmap Presentation:**
    *   Prepare a brief presentation of your roadmap. The presentation should be targeted at the CEO of RetailRevolution and should focus on the business benefits of the proposed security initiatives.

### Submission Format

Please submit your work as a single Markdown file containing:

1.  Your analysis of the business goals and their security implications.
2.  Your 3-year security roadmap, presented in a table.
3.  A brief summary of your presentation to the CEO.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

*   **Alignment of Security and Business Goals:** Does your roadmap clearly support the client's business objectives?
*   **Comprehensiveness and Realism:** Have you proposed a realistic and comprehensive set of initiatives for a company of this size and budget?
*   **Prioritization and Justification:** Is your prioritization of initiatives logical and well-justified?
*   **Clarity and Persuasiveness:** Is your submission clear, concise, and persuasive?

# Module 1.3: Security Strategy Development

## Introduction

A security strategy is a long-term plan that outlines how an organization will protect its information assets. It is a critical component of any effective cybersecurity program, as it provides a roadmap for making decisions about security investments, priorities, and resources. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will be responsible for helping your clients develop and implement a security strategy that is aligned with their business objectives.

## Translating Business Goals into a Security Roadmap

The first step in developing a security strategy is to understand the organization's business goals. What is the organization trying to achieve? What are its key business processes? What are its most critical assets? Once you have a clear understanding of the business, you can begin to translate the business goals into a multi-year security roadmap.

A security roadmap is a high-level plan that outlines the key security initiatives that will be undertaken over a period of three to five years. It should be aligned with the organization's business strategy and should be prioritized based on risk and business impact.

## Strategic Budgeting and Resource Allocation

Once the security roadmap has been developed, the next step is to create a budget and allocate resources. This involves estimating the cost of each security initiative and securing the necessary funding. It also involves identifying the people, processes, and technology that will be needed to implement the roadmap.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

A cost-benefit analysis is a useful tool for justifying security investments. It involves comparing the cost of implementing a security control with the potential benefits (e.g., reduced risk, improved compliance). The results of the cost-benefit analysis can be used to prioritize security initiatives and to demonstrate the ROI of security investments.

## Conclusion

This section has provided an overview of security strategy development, including how to translate business goals into a security roadmap and how to create a budget and allocate resources. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will play a key role in helping your clients develop and implement a security strategy that will protect their information assets and enable them to achieve their business objectives.

# Module 1.4: Foundational Frameworks

## Introduction

Cybersecurity frameworks provide a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risk. They consist of a set of standards, guidelines, and best practices that can be used to assess, implement, and monitor security controls. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will need to have a deep understanding of the most common cybersecurity frameworks and to be able to apply them to your clients' environments.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary framework that was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides a high-level, strategic view of cybersecurity risk and is designed to be applicable to organizations of all sizes and sectors.

The CSF is organized into five core functions:

- **Identify:** Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
- **Protect:** Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.
- **Detect:** Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
- **Respond:** Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.
- **Recover:** Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.

## ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management. It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It includes people, processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process.

ISO 27001 is organized into a number of clauses, including:

- **Information security policies**
- **Organization of information security**
- **Human resource security**
- **Asset management**
- **Access control**
- **Cryptography**
- **Physical and environmental security**
- **Operations security**
- **Communications security**
- **System acquisition, development and maintenance**
- **Supplier relationships**
- **Information security incident management**
- **Information security aspects of business continuity management**
- **Compliance**

## COBIT

COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) is a framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT. It was developed by ISACA and is designed to help organizations create value from their IT investments.

COBIT is organized into five domains:

- **Evaluate, Direct and Monitor (EDM):** This domain is concerned with the governance of IT.
- **Align, Plan and Organize (APO):** This domain is concerned with the planning and organization of IT.
- **Build, Acquire and Implement (BAI):** This domain is concerned with the acquisition and implementation of IT solutions.
- **Deliver, Service and Support (DSS):** This domain is concerned with the delivery and support of IT services.
- **Monitor, Evaluate and Assess (MEA):** This domain is concerned with the monitoring and evaluation of IT performance.

## Conclusion

This section has provided an overview of the most common cybersecurity frameworks. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will need to be able to apply these frameworks to help your clients manage their cybersecurity risks. In the next module, we will delve deeper into the implementation of these frameworks.

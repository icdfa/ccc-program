# Risk Assessment Calculator Guide

## Introduction

A risk assessment calculator is a simple tool that can help you quantify and prioritize risks. This guide provides a basic example of a risk assessment calculator that you can create in a spreadsheet.

## Creating the Calculator

1.  **Open a new spreadsheet** (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets).
2.  **Create the following columns:**
    -   **Risk ID:** A unique identifier for each risk.
    -   **Risk Description:** A brief description of the risk.
    -   **Likelihood (1-5):** The likelihood of the risk occurring (1 = Very Low, 5 = Very High).
    -   **Impact (1-5):** The impact of the risk if it occurs (1 = Very Low, 5 = Very High).
    -   **Risk Score:** The calculated risk score (Likelihood × Impact).
    -   **Risk Level:** The qualitative risk level (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).

## Example

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R-001 | Unauthorized access to customer data | 3 | 5 | 15 | High |
| R-002 | Ransomware attack | 2 | 5 | 10 | Medium |
| R-003 | Phishing attack | 4 | 3 | 12 | Medium |

## Risk Level Matrix

You can use the following matrix to define your risk levels:

| Risk Score | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1-5 | Low |
| 6-10 | Medium |
| 11-15 | High |
| 16-25 | Critical |

## Using the Calculator

1.  **Identify your risks:** Brainstorm a list of potential risks to your organization.
2.  **Assess likelihood and impact:** For each risk, assess the likelihood and impact on a scale of 1 to 5.
3.  **Calculate the risk score:** Multiply the likelihood and impact to get the risk score.
4.  **Determine the risk level:** Use the risk level matrix to determine the qualitative risk level.
5.  **Prioritize your risks:** Focus on the risks with the highest risk scores.

## ROI Calculator

You can extend this calculator to include a simple Return on Investment (ROI) calculation for security controls.

1.  **Add the following columns:**
    -   **Control:** The security control to mitigate the risk.
    -   **Control Cost:** The cost of implementing the control.
    -   **Risk Reduction (1-5):** The amount of risk reduction the control provides.
    -   **ROI:** The return on investment ( (Risk Score × Risk Reduction) / Control Cost ).

This simple calculator can help you make data-driven decisions about which security controls to implement.

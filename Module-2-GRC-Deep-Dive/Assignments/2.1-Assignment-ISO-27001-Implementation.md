## Assignment 2.1: ISO 27001 Implementation - Statement of Applicability (SoA)

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of ISO 27001 implementation and your ability to create a Statement of Applicability (SoA). You will be required to create a comprehensive SoA for a client based on a provided risk assessment report.

### Scenario

**Client:** "SecureSoft," a software development company.

**Background:** SecureSoft is a software development company that specializes in creating custom software for a variety of clients. The company is committed to information security and has decided to pursue ISO 27001 certification. As part of this process, the company has conducted a risk assessment and has provided you with the risk assessment report.

**Risk Assessment Report:** (A simplified risk assessment report will be provided to you as a separate document). The report will identify a number of risks, including:

-   Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
-   Malware infections on employee workstations.
-   Data loss due to hardware failure.
-   Denial-of-service attacks against the company's website.

### Your Task

Based on the provided risk assessment report, create a Statement of Applicability (SoA) for SecureSoft. The SoA should be a formal document that lists all of the controls from Annex A of the ISO 27001 standard. For each control, you should indicate whether it is applicable to SecureSoft's ISMS and provide a brief justification for your decision. You should also indicate whether the control has been implemented and provide a reference to the relevant documentation (if applicable).

### Submission Format

Please submit your SoA as a single Markdown file. The SoA should be well-organized and easy to read. You should use a table to present your SoA.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your SoA will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Completeness:** Does the SoA include all of the controls from Annex A of the ISO 27001 standard?
-   **Accuracy:** Is your assessment of the applicability of each control accurate and well-justified?
-   **Clarity:** Is the SoA clear, concise, and easy to understand?
-   **Professionalism:** Is the SoA professionally written and formatted?

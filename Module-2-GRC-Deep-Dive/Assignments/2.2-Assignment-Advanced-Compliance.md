## Assignment 2.2: Advanced Compliance - GDPR Gap Analysis

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of advanced compliance frameworks and your ability to conduct a GDPR gap analysis. You will be required to conduct a simulated GDPR gap analysis for a multinational e-commerce company and propose remediation steps.

### Scenario

**Client:** "GlobalCart," a multinational e-commerce company.

**Background:** GlobalCart is a large e-commerce company that operates in multiple countries, including several member states of the European Union. The company collects and processes a large amount of personal data from its customers, including names, addresses, payment information, and browsing history. The company is aware of its obligations under the GDPR, but it is not sure if it is fully compliant. The company has hired you, a cybersecurity consultant, to conduct a GDPR gap analysis.

### Your Task

Based on the scenario, conduct a GDPR gap analysis for GlobalCart. Your gap analysis should include the following:

1.  **Data Mapping:** Identify all of the personal data that GlobalCart collects and processes. For each type of data, you should identify where it is stored, how it is used, and who has access to it.
2.  **Gap Analysis:** For each of the key principles of the GDPR (lawfulness, fairness and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality), assess GlobalCart's current practices and identify any gaps.
3.  **Remediation Plan:** For each identified gap, propose a set of remediation steps. The remediation steps should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### Submission Format

Please submit your GDPR gap analysis as a single Markdown file. The gap analysis should be well-organized and easy to read. You should use tables to present your findings.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your GDPR gap analysis will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Comprehensiveness:** Have you identified all of the relevant personal data and GDPR principles?
-   **Accuracy:** Is your gap analysis accurate and well-justified?
-   **Actionability:** Are your remediation steps actionable and realistic?
-   **Clarity:** Is your gap analysis clear, concise, and easy to understand?

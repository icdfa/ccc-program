## Assignment 2.4: Legal and Ethical Consulting - Case Study Analysis

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of the legal and ethical considerations of cybersecurity consulting. You will be required to analyze a case study involving a consultant's ethical dilemma during a security breach investigation and draft an ethical resolution.

### Scenario

**Case Study:** You are a cybersecurity consultant working for a firm, "CyberGuard Consulting." You have been engaged by a financial services company, "Capital Trust Bank," to investigate a data breach. During your investigation, you discover that the breach was caused by an insider threat. An employee, John Doe, intentionally exfiltrated sensitive customer data.

As you delve deeper, you find evidence that John Doe was not acting alone. You uncover a series of emails between John Doe and a senior executive at a rival bank, "Apex Financial." The emails suggest that the executive at Apex Financial offered John Doe a lucrative job in exchange for the stolen data.

Your contact at Capital Trust Bank, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), is under immense pressure to resolve the situation quickly and quietly. The CISO asks you to omit the information about the rival bank from your final report. The CISO's rationale is that a public scandal involving another bank would cause irreparable damage to the entire financial industry and could lead to a loss of customer trust.

### Your Task

1.  **Identify the Ethical Dilemma:** Clearly articulate the ethical dilemma that you are facing as a cybersecurity consultant.
2.  **Analyze the Stakeholders:** Identify all of the stakeholders in this situation and analyze their interests, rights, and obligations.
3.  **Evaluate Your Options:** Evaluate the different courses of action that you could take. For each option, consider the potential consequences for each stakeholder.
4.  **Draft an Ethical Resolution:** Based on your analysis, draft a formal response to the CISO of Capital Trust Bank. In your response, you should:
    -   Acknowledge the CISO's concerns.
    -   Clearly state your ethical position.
    -   Propose a course of action that is both ethical and responsible.
    -   Justify your proposed course of action with reference to relevant ethical principles and professional codes of conduct (e.g., the (ISC)² Code of Ethics).

### Submission Format

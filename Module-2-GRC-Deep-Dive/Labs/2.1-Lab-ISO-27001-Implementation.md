# Lab 2.1: ISO 27001 Implementation - Scoping and SoA Workshop

### Objective

This lab is designed to provide you with a practical, hands-on experience of the initial stages of an ISO 27001 implementation project. You will simulate a workshop with a client to define the scope of their Information Security Management System (ISMS) and begin drafting a Statement of Applicability (SoA).

### Scenario

**Client:** "Innovate Health," a small, innovative healthcare technology company that has developed a new telemedicine platform. 

**Background:** Innovate Health is preparing to launch their platform and needs to demonstrate a strong commitment to information security to gain the trust of patients and healthcare providers. They have decided to pursue ISO 27001 certification and have engaged you as a consultant to guide them through the process.

**Your Role:** You will facilitate a simulated workshop with the key stakeholders at Innovate Health to define the scope of their ISMS and to start the process of creating the SoA.

### Your Task

1.  **Stakeholder Identification and Role-Play:**
    *   You will be provided with a list of key stakeholders at Innovate Health (e.g., CEO, CTO, Head of Product, Legal Counsel). 
    *   For this lab, you will play the role of the cybersecurity consultant, and you should consider the perspectives of each of these stakeholders.

2.  **ISMS Scoping Exercise:**
    *   Based on the company profile, you will define the scope of the ISMS. Consider the following:
        *   What are the key business processes of Innovate Health?
        *   What are the key information assets that need to be protected (e.g., patient data, intellectual property)?
        *   What are the key locations, systems, and departments that should be included in the ISMS?
    *   Draft a formal scope statement for Innovate Health's ISMS.

3.  **Statement of Applicability (SoA) - Initial Draft:**
    *   You will be provided with a template for the SoA.
    *   For a selected subset of controls from ISO 27001 Annex A (a list will be provided), you will work through the process of determining their applicability to Innovate Health.
    *   For each control, you will need to:
        *   Justify your decision for including or excluding the control.
        *   If the control is applicable, provide a brief description of how it could be implemented at Innovate Health.

### Submission Format

Please submit your work as a single Markdown file containing:

1.  The formal ISMS scope statement.
2.  The partially completed SoA, showing your analysis for the selected controls.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

*   **Thoroughness of Scope Definition:** Have you considered all the relevant factors in defining the ISMS scope?
*   **Justification of SoA Decisions:** Is your reasoning for including or excluding controls logical and well-articulated?
*   **Practicality of Implementation Suggestions:** Are your suggestions for implementing controls realistic for a small healthcare technology company?
*   **Clarity and Professionalism:** Is your submission well-organized, clear, and professionally presented?

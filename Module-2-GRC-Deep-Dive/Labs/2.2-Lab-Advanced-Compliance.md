# Lab 2.2: Advanced Compliance - Compliance Crosswalk

### Objective

This lab will provide you with a practical understanding of how different compliance frameworks overlap and intersect. You will create a "compliance crosswalk" that maps the requirements of two or more compliance frameworks to each other.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Global Health," a multinational healthcare organization.

**Background:** Global Health operates in both the United States and the European Union. As a result, the company is subject to both HIPAA and GDPR. The company is looking for ways to streamline its compliance efforts and to avoid duplicating work.

**Your Role:** You are a cybersecurity consultant who has been hired by Global Health to help them understand the similarities and differences between HIPAA and GDPR.

### Your Task

1.  **Research HIPAA and GDPR:** Conduct research on the key requirements of HIPAA and GDPR. You should focus on the requirements that are related to information security and data protection.
2.  **Create a Compliance Crosswalk:** Create a table that maps the requirements of HIPAA to the requirements of GDPR. For each requirement, you should provide a brief description and indicate whether it is a shared requirement or a unique requirement.
3.  **Identify Opportunities for Harmonization:** Based on your compliance crosswalk, identify opportunities for Global Health to harmonize its compliance efforts. For example, could the company create a single set of policies and procedures that would satisfy both HIPAA and GDPR?
4.  **Develop a Set of Recommendations:** Develop a set of recommendations for Global Health on how to streamline its compliance efforts. Your recommendations should be actionable and should be prioritized based on their potential impact.

### Submission Format

Please submit your work as a single Markdown file containing:

1.  Your compliance crosswalk table.
2.  Your analysis of the opportunities for harmonization.
3.  Your recommendations for streamlining compliance efforts.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

*   **Accuracy and Comprehensiveness:** Is your compliance crosswalk accurate and comprehensive?
*   **Insightfulness of Analysis:** Is your analysis of the opportunities for harmonization insightful and well-reasoned?
*   **Actionability of Recommendations:** Are your recommendations actionable and realistic?
*   **Clarity and Professionalism:** Is your submission clear, concise, and professionally presented?

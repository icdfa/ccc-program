# Lab 2.3: Security Auditing and Assurance - Audit Simulation

### Objective

This lab will provide you with a hands-on experience of conducting a security audit. You will simulate the process of auditing a client's security controls and writing an audit report.

### Scenario

**Client:** "E-Shop," a small e-commerce company.

**Background:** E-Shop is preparing for its first PCI DSS audit. The company has implemented a number of security controls to protect cardholder data, but it is not sure if it is fully compliant. The company has hired you, a cybersecurity consultant, to conduct a pre-audit assessment.

**Your Role:** You will act as a cybersecurity consultant and will conduct a simulated audit of E-Shop's security controls.

### Your Task

1.  **Audit Checklist:**
    *   You will be provided with a simplified PCI DSS audit checklist.
    *   The checklist will list a number of security controls that are required by PCI DSS.

2.  **Evidence Review:**
    *   You will be provided with a set of simulated evidence, such as policy documents, network diagrams, and vulnerability scan reports.
    *   You will review the evidence to determine whether E-Shop is compliant with each of the controls on the checklist.

3.  **Audit Report:**
    *   Based on your review of the evidence, you will write a formal audit report. The report should include the following sections:
        *   An executive summary.
        *   The scope and objectives of the audit.
        *   The methodology used.
        *   The findings and recommendations.
        *   The overall conclusion.

### Submission Format

Please submit your work as a single Markdown file containing your audit report.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

*   **Thoroughness of Audit:** Have you thoroughly reviewed the evidence and assessed all of the controls on the checklist?
*   **Accuracy of Findings:** Are your audit findings accurate and well-supported by the evidence?
*   **Actionability of Recommendations:** Are your recommendations actionable and realistic?
*   **Clarity and Professionalism:** Is your audit report clear, concise, and professionally written?

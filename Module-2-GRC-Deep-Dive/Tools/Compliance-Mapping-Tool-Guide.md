# Compliance Mapping Tool Guide

## Introduction

A compliance mapping tool can help you map your security controls to multiple compliance frameworks. This can save you a significant amount of time and effort when you need to comply with multiple regulations.

## Creating the Tool

You can create a simple compliance mapping tool in a spreadsheet.

1.  **Open a new spreadsheet** (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets).
2.  **Create the following columns:**
    -   **Control ID:** A unique identifier for each of your security controls.
    -   **Control Description:** A brief description of the control.
    -   **ISO 27001:** A column to map the control to the relevant ISO 27001 control.
    -   **NIST CSF:** A column to map the control to the relevant NIST CSF control.
    -   **PCI DSS:** A column to map the control to the relevant PCI DSS requirement.
    -   **HIPAA:** A column to map the control to the relevant HIPAA security rule.

## Example

| Control ID | Control Description | ISO 27001 | NIST CSF | PCI DSS | HIPAA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C-001 | Access Control Policy | A.9.1.1 | PR.AC-1 | 7.1 | 164.312(a)(1) |
| C-002 | Encryption of Data in Transit | A.14.1.3 | PR.DS-2 | 4.1 | 164.312(e)(1) |
| C-003 | Incident Response Plan | A.16.1.7 | RS.RP-1 | 12.10 | 164.308(a)(6) |

## Using the Tool

1.  **List your controls:** Create a list of all your security controls.
2.  **Map your controls:** For each control, identify the relevant control or requirement in each of the compliance frameworks.
3.  **Identify gaps:** Use the tool to identify any gaps in your control coverage.
4.  **Prioritize your efforts:** Focus on implementing the controls that are required by multiple frameworks.

## GRC Platforms

For more advanced compliance mapping, you can use a GRC platform. GRC platforms provide a centralized repository for all your compliance data and can automate many of the tasks involved in compliance management.

Some popular GRC platforms include:

-   ServiceNow GRC
-   Archer
-   LogicGate
-   ZenGRC

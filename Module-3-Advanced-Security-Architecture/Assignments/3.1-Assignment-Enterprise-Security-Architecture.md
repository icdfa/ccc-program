## Assignment 3.1: Enterprise Security Architecture - Zero Trust Architecture Design

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of enterprise security architecture and your ability to design a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) model. You will be required to design a ZTA model for a hybrid-cloud enterprise environment.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Hybrid Solutions," a large enterprise that has a mix of on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure.

**Background:** Hybrid Solutions is a growing enterprise that has been migrating some of its applications and data to the cloud. The company currently has a traditional perimeter-based security model, but it is concerned that this model is no longer effective in a hybrid-cloud environment. The company has decided to adopt a Zero Trust security model and has hired you, a cybersecurity consultant, to design a ZTA model.

**Environment:**

-   **On-premises:** The company has a data center with a variety of servers, including web servers, application servers, and database servers.
-   **Cloud:** The company is using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host some of its applications and data. The company is using a variety of AWS services, including EC2, S3, and RDS.
-   **Users:** The company has a mix of on-site and remote users.

### Your Task

Based on the scenario, design a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) model for Hybrid Solutions. Your ZTA model should be comprehensive and should address the following:

1.  **Identity and Access Management:** How will you authenticate and authorize users and devices?
2.  **Micro-segmentation:** How will you segment the network to limit the blast radius of a security breach?
3.  **Least Privilege:** How will you ensure that users and devices only have the minimum level of access that they need to perform their jobs?
4.  **Continuous Monitoring:** How will you continuously monitor the network for signs of malicious activity?
5.  **Automation and Orchestration:** How will you automate and orchestrate security controls to improve efficiency and effectiveness?

### Submission Format

Please submit your ZTA model as a single Markdown file. The model should be well-organized and easy to read. You should use diagrams to help illustrate your model.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your ZTA model will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Comprehensiveness:** Does the model address all of the key principles of Zero Trust?
-   **Feasibility:** Is the model feasible to implement in a hybrid-cloud environment?
-   **Clarity:** Is the model clear, concise, and easy to understand?
-   **Innovation:** Does the model incorporate any innovative or forward-thinking ideas?

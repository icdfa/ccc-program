## Assignment 3.2: Cloud Security Strategy - Secure Cloud Migration Strategy

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of cloud security strategy and your ability to develop a secure cloud migration strategy. You will be required to develop a secure cloud migration strategy for a client moving from on-premise to a major cloud provider.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Legacy Systems," a traditional enterprise with a large on-premise data center.

**Background:** Legacy Systems is looking to modernize its IT infrastructure and has decided to migrate some of its applications and data to Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company is concerned about the security implications of this migration and has hired you, a cybersecurity consultant, to develop a secure cloud migration strategy.

**Applications to be Migrated:**

-   A customer relationship management (CRM) system.
-   A human resources (HR) system.
-   A public-facing website.

### Your Task

Based on the scenario, develop a secure cloud migration strategy for Legacy Systems. Your strategy should be comprehensive and should address the following:

1.  **Data Classification:** How will you classify the data that is being migrated to the cloud?
2.  **Shared Responsibility Model:** How will you educate the client on the shared responsibility model in AWS?
3.  **Identity and Access Management:** How will you manage identities and access in AWS?
4.  **Network Security:** How will you secure the network in AWS?
5.  **Data Protection:** How will you protect the data in AWS, both in transit and at rest?
6.  **Monitoring and Logging:** How will you monitor and log activity in AWS?
7.  **Incident Response:** How will you respond to security incidents in AWS?

### Submission Format

Please submit your secure cloud migration strategy as a single Markdown file. The strategy should be well-organized and easy to read. You should use diagrams to help illustrate your strategy.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your secure cloud migration strategy will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Comprehensiveness:** Does the strategy address all of the key aspects of cloud security?
-   **Feasibility:** Is the strategy feasible to implement for a traditional enterprise?
-   **Clarity:** Is the strategy clear, concise, and easy to understand?
-   **Best Practices:** Does the strategy incorporate cloud security best practices?

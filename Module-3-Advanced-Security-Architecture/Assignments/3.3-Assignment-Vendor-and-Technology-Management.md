## Assignment 3.3: Vendor and Technology Management - Vendor Evaluation

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of vendor and technology management and your ability to evaluate competing security vendors. You will be required to evaluate two competing security vendors using a standardized TPRA scorecard and present a final recommendation.

### Scenario

**Client:** "SecureNet," a company that is looking to purchase a new Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.

**Background:** SecureNet has narrowed down its choices to two vendors: "LogGuard" and "ThreatScanner." The company has provided you with the vendors marketing materials and has asked you, a cybersecurity consultant, to evaluate the two vendors and to make a recommendation.

**Vendor Marketing Materials:** (Simplified marketing materials for LogGuard and ThreatScanner will be provided to you as separate documents). The materials will highlight the key features and benefits of each SIEM solution.

### Your Task

1.  **Develop a TPRA Scorecard:** Develop a Third-Party Risk Assessment (TPRA) scorecard to evaluate the two SIEM vendors. The scorecard should include a list of criteria that are important for a SIEM solution, such as:
    *   Log collection and management capabilities.
    *   Threat detection and response capabilities.
    *   Reporting and compliance capabilities.
    *   Scalability and performance.
    *   Ease of use and administration.
    *   Cost.
2.  **Evaluate the Vendors:** Evaluate the two vendors using your TPRA scorecard. For each criterion, you should assign a score to each vendor and provide a brief justification for your score.
3.  **Make a Recommendation:** Based on your evaluation, make a recommendation to SecureNet on which SIEM solution to purchase. Your recommendation should be well-justified and should be based on the results of your TPRA scorecard.

### Submission Format

Please submit your work as a single Markdown file containing:

1.  Your TPRA scorecard.
2.  Your evaluation of the two vendors.
3.  Your final recommendation.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Comprehensiveness of Scorecard:** Does your scorecard include all of the key criteria for a SIEM solution?
*   **Objectivity of Evaluation:** Is your evaluation of the two vendors objective and well-supported by the evidence?
*   **Soundness of Recommendation:** Is your recommendation well-reasoned and justified?
*   **Clarity and Professionalism:** Is your submission clear, concise, and professionally presented?

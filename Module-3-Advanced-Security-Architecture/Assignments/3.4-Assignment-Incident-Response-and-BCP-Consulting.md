## Assignment 3.4: Incident Response and BCP Consulting - Tabletop Exercise

### Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of incident response and BCP consulting and your ability to lead a tabletop exercise. You will be required to lead a tabletop exercise for a major cyber incident with executive stakeholders, documenting lessons learned.

### Scenario

**Client:** "Global Bank," a large financial institution.

**Background:** Global Bank has a mature incident response program, but it has never been tested against a major cyber incident. The CISO has asked you, a cybersecurity consultant, to lead a tabletop exercise to test the bank's incident response plan (IRP) and business continuity plan (BCP).

**Incident Scenario:** A sophisticated ransomware attack has encrypted the bank's core banking system, making it impossible for customers to access their accounts. The attackers are demanding a large ransom in cryptocurrency.

### Your Task

1.  **Develop a Tabletop Exercise Plan:** Develop a plan for the tabletop exercise. The plan should include the following:
    *   The objectives of the exercise.
    *   The scope of the exercise.
    *   The participants in the exercise.
    *   The scenario for the exercise.
    *   The injects for the exercise (i.e., a series of events that will be introduced during the exercise to test the participants' responses).
2.  **Facilitate the Tabletop Exercise:** Facilitate the tabletop exercise with the executive stakeholders. You should guide the participants through the scenario and the injects, and you should encourage them to discuss their roles and responsibilities.
3.  **Document Lessons Learned:** Document the lessons learned from the tabletop exercise. The lessons learned should identify any weaknesses in the bank's IRP and BCP, and they should include recommendations for improvement.

### Submission Format

Please submit your work as a single Markdown file containing:

1.  Your tabletop exercise plan.
2.  A summary of the key discussions and decisions that were made during the exercise.
3.  Your list of lessons learned and recommendations for improvement.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Realism of Scenario:** Is the scenario realistic and challenging?
*   **Effectiveness of Facilitation (as demonstrated in your submission):** Does your submission reflect a well-structured and productive exercise?
*   **Insightfulness of Lessons Learned:** Are the lessons learned insightful and well-reasoned?
*   **Actionability of Recommendations:** Are the recommendations actionable and realistic?

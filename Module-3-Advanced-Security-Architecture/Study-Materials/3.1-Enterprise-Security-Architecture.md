# Module 3.1: Enterprise Security Architecture

## Introduction

Enterprise Security Architecture (ESA) is the practice of applying a comprehensive and rigorous method for describing a current and/or future structure and behavior for an organization's security processes, information security systems, personnel, and organizational sub-units, so that they align with the organization's core goals and strategic direction. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will be responsible for designing and implementing ESAs that are effective, efficient, and aligned with your clients' business needs.

## Security Architecture Frameworks

Security architecture frameworks provide a structured approach to designing and implementing ESAs. They can help to ensure that all aspects of security are considered and that the ESA is aligned with the organization's overall enterprise architecture.

### TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)

TOGAF is a popular enterprise architecture framework that can be used to develop a wide range of different architectures, including security architectures. TOGAF provides a set of tools, methods, and a common vocabulary for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise architecture.

### SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture)

SABSA is a framework and methodology for enterprise security architecture and service management. It is a risk-driven framework that is designed to help organizations develop a security architecture that is aligned with their business objectives.

## Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

Zero Trust is a security model that is based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that there is no traditional network edge; networks can be local, in the cloud, or a combination or hybrid with resources anywhere as well as workers in any location. The ZTA is a security architecture that is designed to implement the Zero Trust model.

### Key Principles of ZTA

- **Identity and access management:** All users and devices must be authenticated and authorized before they are granted access to resources.
- **Micro-segmentation:** The network is divided into small, isolated segments to limit the blast radius of a security breach.
- **Least privilege:** Users and devices are only granted the minimum level of access that they need to perform their jobs.
- **Continuous monitoring:** All activity on the network is continuously monitored for signs of malicious activity.

## Conclusion

This section has provided an overview of enterprise security architecture, including security architecture frameworks and the Zero Trust model. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will need to be able to apply these concepts to help your clients design and implement effective security architectures. In the next section, we will discuss cloud security strategy.

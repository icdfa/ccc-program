# Module 3.3: Vendor and Technology Management

## Introduction

In today's interconnected world, organizations rely on a wide range of vendors and technologies to support their business operations. This introduces new security risks that must be managed effectively. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will need to help your clients develop and implement a vendor and technology management program that is designed to mitigate these risks.

## Due Diligence

Before entering into a relationship with a new vendor, it is important to conduct due diligence to assess their security posture. This should include a review of their security policies, procedures, and controls. It is also important to assess their financial stability and reputation.

## Third-Party Risk Assessment (TPRA)

A third-party risk assessment (TPRA) is a formal process for assessing the security risks associated with a third-party vendor. The TPRA should be conducted before entering into a relationship with a new vendor and should be repeated on a regular basis.

### TPRA Scorecard

A TPRA scorecard can be used to standardize the vendor assessment process. The scorecard should include a list of security controls and a rating scale for each control. The results of the scorecard can be used to compare different vendors and to identify areas where a vendor needs to improve their security.

## Defining Security Requirements for RFPs

When issuing a request for proposal (RFP) for a new technology or service, it is important to include a set of security requirements. The security requirements should be based on the organization's security policies and standards. They should also be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

## Contract Security Negotiation

Once a vendor has been selected, it is important to negotiate a contract that includes strong security provisions. The contract should address the following:

- **Confidentiality:** The vendor should be required to protect the confidentiality of the organization's data.
- **Security controls:** The vendor should be required to implement a set of security controls to protect the organization's data.
- **Audits:** The organization should have the right to audit the vendor's security controls.
- **Breach notification:** The vendor should be required to notify the organization in the event of a security breach.

## Conclusion

This section has provided an overview of vendor and technology management. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will need to be able to help your clients develop and implement a vendor and technology management program that is designed to mitigate the security risks associated with third-party vendors. In the next section, we will discuss incident response and BCP consulting.

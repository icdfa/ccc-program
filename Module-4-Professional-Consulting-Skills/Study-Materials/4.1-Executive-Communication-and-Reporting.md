# Module 4.1: Executive Communication and Reporting

## Introduction

As a cybersecurity consultant, your ability to communicate effectively with executive leadership is just as important as your technical expertise. Executives are not interested in the technical details of security; they want to understand the business implications of security risks and the ROI of security investments. This module will teach you how to craft compelling executive summaries, present complex technical findings to non-technical boards, and use data visualization to communicate security metrics.

## Crafting Compelling Executive Summaries

An executive summary is a high-level summary of a longer report or document. It is often the only part of a report that an executive will read, so it is essential that it is clear, concise, and compelling. The executive summary should be no more than one page long and should include the following information:

- The purpose of the report
- The key findings and recommendations
- The business implications of the findings
- The recommended course of action

## Presenting to Non-Technical Boards

When presenting to a non-technical board, it is important to avoid technical jargon and to use business-friendly language. You should also focus on the business implications of your findings and recommendations. Use analogies and storytelling to help the board understand complex technical concepts. And be prepared to answer questions about the financial implications of your recommendations.

## Data Visualization for Security Metrics

Data visualization is a powerful tool for communicating security metrics to executive leadership. A well-designed chart or graph can help to make complex data more understandable and can highlight key trends and patterns. When creating data visualizations, it is important to choose the right chart type for the data and to keep the visualization simple and easy to read.

### Key Security Metrics for Executives

- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** The average time it takes to detect a security incident.
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):** The average time it takes to respond to a security incident.
- **Number of critical vulnerabilities:** The number of critical vulnerabilities that have been identified in the organization's systems.
- **Patching cadence:** The speed at which the organization is able to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Security awareness training completion rate:** The percentage of employees who have completed security awareness training.

The capstone project is designed to give you a realistic experience of what it is like to work as a cybersecurity consultant.

## The Scenario

The capstone project will be based on a detailed scenario that will be provided to you at the beginning of Module 4. The scenario will describe a fictional organization that is facing a variety of cybersecurity challenges. You will be required to act as a cybersecurity consultant and to provide the organization with a comprehensive set of recommendations.

## The Evaluation

The capstone project will be evaluated based on the quality of your deliverables. The deliverables will be assessed on their technical accuracy, strategic relevance, and professional presentation. The capstone project is worth 40% of your final grade for the CCC program.
